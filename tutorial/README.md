# vks Tutorial

This is a quick tutorial, based on [my previous vulkan-go tutorial](https://github.com/ibd1279/vulkangotutorial/tree/main/tutorial), which was originally based on [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

* **Part 1** focuses on getting the initial structure on Device created.
* **Part 2** focuses on creating the [pipeline basics](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Graphics_pipeline_basics/Introduction) with the API.
